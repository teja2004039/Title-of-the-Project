CRYPTOCURRENCY MARKET PRICE PREDICTION USING DATA SCIENCE MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES

About

Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile and influenced by various factors, including demand and supply, investor sentiment, global events, and regulations. This project aims to use machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to predict the future prices of cryptocurrencies based on historical data, market indicators, and sentiment analysis.

Features

1.Real-Time & Historical Data Collection – Fetches live and past cryptocurrency price data from APIs like Binance, CoinGecko, and Yahoo Finance.

2.Technical & Sentiment Analysis – Uses technical indicators (SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD) and social media sentiment (Twitter, Reddit) for better predictions.

3. Machine Learning & Deep Learning Models – Implements Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM, and Transformers for accurate price forecasting.
 
4. Visualization & Insights – Provides interactive charts, correlation heatmaps, and feature importance graphs for better decision-making.
   
5. Web App & API Deployment – Deploys the model using Flask, FastAPI, or Streamlit, allowing real-time predictions and trading bot integration.

Requirements

1️.Programming Language – Python with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras.

2️. Data Sources – Market data from Binance, CoinGecko, Yahoo Finance; Sentiment data from Twitter, Reddit.

3️. Machine Learning Models – Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM, Transformers for prediction.

4️. Hardware Requirements – Minimum 8GB RAM, i5/Ryzen 5 processor, GPU (optional for deep learning).

5. Deployment & Integration – Web app using Flask, FastAPI, Streamlit; Cloud hosting on AWS, GCP, or Heroku.
